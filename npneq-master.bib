	abstract = {Performing high accuracy hybrid functional calculations for condensed matter systems containing a large number of atoms is at present computationally very demanding or even out of reach if high quality basis sets are used. We present a highly optimized multiple graphics processing unit implementation of the exact exchange operator which allows one to perform fast hybrid functional density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with systematic basis sets without additional approximations for up to a thousand atoms. With this method hybrid DFT calculations of high quality become accessible on state-of-the-art supercomputers within a time-to-solution that is of the same order of magnitude as traditional semilocal-GGA functionals. The method is implemented in a portable open-source library.}

abstract="Exascale computing aspires to meet the increasing demands from large scientific applications. Software targeting exascale is typically designed for heterogeneous architectures; henceforth, it is not only important to develop well-designed software, but also make it aware of the hardware architecture and efficiently exploit its power. Currently, several and diverse applications, such as those part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) in the United States, rely on efficient computation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In this context, we present the design and implementation of heFFTe (Highly Efficient FFT for Exascale) library, which targets the upcoming exascale supercomputers. We provide highly (linearly) scalable GPU kernels that achieve more than {\$}{\$}40{\{}{\backslash}times {\}}{\$}{\$}speedup with respect to local kernels from CPU state-of-the-art libraries, and over {\$}{\$}2{\{}{\backslash}times {\}}{\$}{\$}speedup for the whole FFT computation. A communication model for parallel FFTs is also provided to analyze the bottleneck for large-scale problems. We show experiments obtained on Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, using up to 24,576 IBM Power9 cores and 6,144 NVIDIA V-100 GPUs.",

We develop a tight binding model for dynamically disordered MAPbI\$\_3\$ based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations to calculate electronic structure for finite temperature crystal structures at the length scale of thermal disorder and carrier localization. The model predicts individual Hamiltonian matrix elements and band structures with high accuracy, owing to the inclusion of additional matrix elements and descriptors for non-Coulombic interactions. We apply the model to electronic structure calculations in supercells up to 16 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 16 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 16, observing the onset of carrier localization induced by thermal disorder at 300 K, associated with decreasing band edge fluctuations, increasing carrier mass, and Rashba splitting approaching zero.

	abstract = {Antiferromagnetic materials could represent the future of spintronic applications thanks to the numerous interesting features they combine: they are robust against perturbation due to magnetic fields, produce no stray fields, display ultrafast dynamics, and are capable of generating large magnetotransport effects. Intense research efforts over the past decade have been invested in unraveling spin transport properties in antiferromagnetic materials. Whether spin transport can be used to drive the antiferromagnetic order and how subsequent variations can be detected are some of the thrilling challenges currently being addressed. Antiferromagnetic spintronics started out with studies on spin transfer and has undergone a definite revival in the last few years with the publication of pioneering articles on the use of spin-orbit interactions in antiferromagnets. This paradigm shift offers possibilities for radically new concepts for spin manipulation in electronics. Central to these endeavors are the need for predictive models, relevant disruptive materials, and new experimental designs. This paper reviews the most prominent spintronic effects described based on theoretical and experimental analysis of antiferromagnetic materials. It also details some of the remaining bottlenecks and suggests possible avenues for future research. This review covers both spin-transfer-related effects, such as spin-transfer torque, spin penetration length, domain-wall motion, and "magnetization" dynamics, and spin-orbit related phenomena, such as (tunnel) anisotropic magnetoresistance, spin Hall, and inverse spin galvanic effects. Effects related to spin caloritronics, such as the spin Seebeck effect, are linked to the transport of magnons in antiferromagnets. The propagation of spin waves and spin superfluids in antiferromagnets is also covered.},

	abstract = {We present an algorithm and implementation for the parallel computation of exact exchange in Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) that exhibits greatly improved strong scaling. QE is an open-source software package for electronic structure calculations using plane wave density functional theory, and supports the use of local, semi-local, and hybrid DFT functionals. Wider application of hybrid functionals is desirable for the improved simulation of electronic band energy alignments and thermodynamic properties, but the computational complexity of evaluating the exact exchange potential limits the practical application of hybrid functionals to large systems and requires efficient implementations. We demonstrate that existing implementations of hybrid DFT that utilize a single data structure for both the local and exact exchange regions of the code are significantly limited in the degree of parallelization achievable. We present a band-pair parallelization approach, in which the calculation of exact exchange is parallelized and evaluated independently from the parallelization of the remainder of the calculation, with the wavefunction data being efficiently transformed on-the-fly into a form that is optimal for each part of the calculation. For a 64 water molecule supercell, our new algorithm reduces the overall time to solution by nearly an order of magnitude.},

@techreport{Beck2002,
	abstract = {Quite simply, test-driven development is meant to eliminate fear in application development. While some fear is healthy (often viewed as a conscience that tells programmers to "be careful!"), the author believes that byproducts of fear include tentative, grumpy, and uncommunicative programmers who are unable to absorb constructive criticism. When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and are better equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them. TDD eliminates tentative traits, it teaches programmers to communicate, and it encourages team members to seek out criticism However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out individually! In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be continually tested and refactored. Kent Beck teaches programmers by example, so they can painlessly and dramatically increase the quality of their work.},

@article{Breit1932,
	abstract = {An improvement is made on a previous attempt to treat two particles by means of Dirac's equation. The approximate equation (1) below is considered in successive steps. The first step, following Oppenheimer, includes the electrostatic energy exactly, rather than to the first in power in e2. This makes it possible to use it as a good starting point in the calculation of spectral terms. The second step brings in the energy due to the interaction of the electric currents. It is given by (9) below. Maxwell's equations and the conservation of energy (see (8.5)) demand the validity of the diagonal matrix elements of this expression as a first order perturbation energy, independently of theories of light quanta. The interactions of the particles with themselves give additive constants in the energy within the limits of the approximation used. Within the same limits the results are in agreement with experiment. {\textcopyright} 1932 The American Physical Society.},

 abstract = {The Born–Oppenheimer approximation underlies much of chemical simulation and provides the framework defining the potential energy surfaces that are used for much of our pictorial understanding of chemical phenomena. However, this approximation breaks down when the dynamics of molecules in excited electronic states are considered. Describing dynamics when the Born–Oppenheimer approximation breaks down requires a quantum mechanical description of the nuclei. Chemical reaction dynamics on excited electronic states is critical for many applications in renewable energy, chemical synthesis, and bioimaging. Furthermore, it is necessary in order to connect with many ultrafast pump–probe spectroscopic experiments. In this review, we provide an overview of methods that can describe nonadiabatic dynamics, with emphasis on those that are able to simultaneously address the quantum mechanics of both electrons and nuclei. Such ab initio quantum molecular dynamics methods solve the electronic Schrödinger equation alongside the nuclear dynamics and thereby avoid the need for precalculation of potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements. Two main families of methods are commonly employed to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics in molecules: full quantum dynamics, such as the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method, and classical trajectory-based approaches, such as trajectory surface hopping. In this review, we describe a third class of methods that is intermediate between the two: Gaussian basis set expansions built around trajectories.},

 abstract = {We investigate the fundamental mechanism of spin-phonon coupling in the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center (NV−) in diamond in order to calculate the spin lattice relaxation time T1 and its temperature dependence from first principles. Starting from the dipolar spin-spin interaction between two electrons, we couple the spins of the electrons to the movements of the ions and end up with an effective spin-phonon interaction potential Vs−ph. Taking this time-dependent potential as a perturbation of the system, a Fermi's golden rule expression for transition rates is obtained which allows us to calculate the spin lattice relaxation time T1. We find that the temperature dependence of T1 is determined by the the zero-temperature transition rate Γ0. We simulate the color center ab initio to extract the figures necessary to quantify Γ0. We calculate the local phonon modes of the color center within the harmonic approximation using the small displacement method and extract the phononic density of states and band structure by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix. We show that our model allows us to calculate T1 in good agreement with experimental observations.},

abstract = {We present a systematic density functional theory (DFT) plus Hubbard U study of structural trends and the stability of different magnetically ordered states across the rare-earth nickelate series, RNiO3, with R from Lu to La. In particular, we investigate how the magnetic order, the change of the rare-earth ion, and the Hubbard interaction U are affecting the bond-length disproportionation between the nickel sites. Our results show that structural parameters can be obtained that are in very good agreement with present experimental data and that DFT+U is in principle able to capture the most important structural trends across the nickelate series. However, the amplitude of the bond-length disproportionation depends very strongly on the specific value used for the Hubbard U parameter and also on the type of magnetic order imposed in the calculation. Regarding the relative stability of different magnetic orderings, a realistic antiferromagnetic order, consistent with the experimental observations, is favored for small U values and becomes more and more favorable compared to the ferromagnetic state towards the end of the series (i.e., towards R=Pr). Nevertheless, it seems that the stability of the ferromagnetic state is generally overestimated within the DFT+U calculations. Our work provides a profound starting point for more detailed experimental investigations and also for future studies using more advanced computational techniques such as, e.g., DFT combined with dynamical mean-field theory.},

	abstract = {The graphics processing unit (GPU) has emerged as a computational accelerator that dramatically reduces the time to discovery in high-end computing (HEC). However, while today's state-of-the-art GPU can easily reduce the execution time of a parallel code by many orders of magnitude, it arguably comes at the expense of significant power and energy consumption. For example,the NVIDIA GTX 280 video card is rated at 236 watts, which is as much as the rest of a compute node, thus requiring a 500-W power supply. As a consequence, the GPU has been viewed as a "nongreen" computing solution. This paper seeks to characterize, and perhaps debunk, the notion of a "power-hungry GPU" via an empirical study of the performance, power, and energy characteristics of GPUs for scientific computing. Specifically, we take an important biological code that runs in a traditional CPU environment and transform and map it to a hybrid CPU+GPU environment. The end result is that our hybrid CPU+GPU environment, hereafter referred to simply as GPU environment, delivers an energy-delay product that is multiple orders of magnitude better than a traditional CPU environment, whether unicore or multicore. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast charge and spin excitations in the elusive terahertz regime of the electromagnetic spectrum play a pivotal role in condensed matter. The electric field of free-space terahertz pulses has provided a direct gateway to manipulating the motion of charges on the femtosecond timescale. Here, we complement this process by showing that the magnetic component of intense terahertz transients enables ultrafast control of the spin degree of freedom. Single-cycle terahertz pulses switch on and off coherent spin waves in antiferromagnetic NiO at frequencies as high as 1 THz. An optical probe pulse with a duration of 8 fs follows the terahertz-induced magnetic dynamics directly in the time domain and verifies that the terahertz field addresses spins selectively by means of the Zeeman interaction. This concept provides a universal ultrafast means to control previously inaccessible magnetic excitations in the electronic ground state. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We use this to study intense, short, laser pulse-induced demagnetization in bulk Fe, Co, Ni and find that demagnetization can take place on time scales of {\textless}20 fs. It is demonstrated that this form of demagnetization is a two-step process: excitation of a fraction of electrons followed by spin-flip transitions mediated by spin–orbit coupling of the remaining localized electrons. We further show that it is possible to control the moment loss by tunable laser parameters, including frequency, duration, and intensity.},

Although numerous studies have been conducted on the dynamics of the hydrated electron, its partner arising from ionization of liquid water, H2O+, remains elusive. We used tunable femtosecond soft x-ray pulses from an x-ray free electron laser to reveal the dynamics of the valence hole created by strong-field ionization and to track the primary proton transfer reaction giving rise to the formation of OH. The isolated resonance associated with the valence hole (H2O+/OH) enabled straightforward detection. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the x-ray spectra are sensitive to structural dynamics at the ionization site. We found signatures of hydrated-electron dynamics in the x-ray spectrum.},

@article{Mostofi2008,
abstract = {We present wannier90, a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWF) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWF in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWF can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90 is able to output MLWF for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. wannier90 is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Nature of problem: Obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be entangled. Solution method: In the case of entangled bands, the optimally-connected subspace of interest is determined by minimising a functional which measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally-localised Wannier functions within this subspace are obtained by subsequent minimisation of a functional that represents the total spread of the Wannier functions in real space. For the case of isolated energy bands only the second step of the procedure is required. Unusual features: Simple and user-friendly input system. Wannier functions and interpolated band structure output in a variety of file formats for visualisation. Running time: Test cases take 1 minute. References: [1] N. Marzari, D.

	abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations of transient core-level spectroscopies require a balanced treatment of both valence- and core-electron excitations. To this end, tuned range-separated hybrid exchange-correlation functionals within the generalized Kohn-Sham scheme offer a computationally efficient means of simultaneously improving the accuracy of valence and core excitation energies in TDDFT by mitigating delocalization errors across multiple length-scales. In this work range-separated hybrid functionals are employed in conjunction with the velocity-gauge formulation of real-time TDDFT to simulate static as well as transient soft X-ray near-edge absorption spectra in a prototypical solid-state system, monolayer hexagonal boron nitride, where excitonic effects are important. In the static case, computed soft X-ray absorption edge energies and line shapes are seen to be in good agreement with experiment. Following laser excitation by a pump pulse, soft X-ray probe spectra are shown to exhibit characteristic features of population induced bleaching and transient energy shifts of exciton peaks. The methods outlined in this work therefore illustrate a practical means for simulating attosecond time-resolved core-level spectra in solids within a TDDFT framework.},

abstract = {Perovskite solar cells have attracted intense attention over the past decade because of their low cost, abundant raw materials, and rapidly growing power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, nonradiative charge carrier losses still constitute a major factor limiting the PCE to well below the Shockley-Queisser limit. This Perspective summarizes recent atomistic quantum dynamics studies on the photoinduced excited-state processes in metal halide perovskites (MHPs), including both hybrid organic-inorganic and all-inorganic MHPs and three- and two-dimensional MHPs. The simulations, performed using a combination of time-domain ab initio density functional theory and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, allow emphasis on various intrinsic and extrinsic features, such as components, structure, dimensionality and interface engineering, control and exposure to various environmental factors, defects, surfaces, and their passivation. The detailed atomistic simulations advance our understanding of electron-vibrational dynamics in MHPs and provide valuable guidelines for enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells.},

Its parameters have been extracted from first-principles calculations. Beyond a critical intensity of a femtosecond light pulse, the material undergoes an ultrafast and nonthermal magnetic phase transition from a noncollinear to collinear antiferromagnetic phase. The light-pulse excites selectively either a spin-nematic or a ferroelectric phase, depending on the light polarization. The behavior can be traced to an optically induced ferromagnetic coupling between Mn trimers, i.e., polarons which are delocalized over three Mn sites. The polarization guides the polymerization of the polaronic crystal into distinct patterns of ferromagnetic chains determining the target phase.},

We pay special attention to the combined effects of magnetic field h, spatial anisotropy R and spin magnitude S. The focus of the review is on the novel collinear spin density wave and spin nematic states, which are characterized by fully gapped transverse spin excitations with Sz = ± 1. We discuss extensively the R − h phase diagram of the antiferromagnet, both in the large-S semiclassical limit and the quantum S = 1/2 limit. When possible, we point out connections with experimental findings.},

Within our approach, we drive the system out of equilibrium using an ultrashort magnetic kick perpendicular to the ground-state magnetization of the material. The dynamical properties of the system are obtained by propagating the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations in real time, and the analysis of the time-dependent magnetization reveals the transverse magnetic excitation spectrum of the magnet. We illustrate the performance of the method by computing the magnetization dynamics, obtained from a real-time propagation, for iron, cobalt, and nickel and compare them to known results obtained using the linear-response formulation of time-dependent density functional theory. Moreover, we point out that our time-dependent approach is not limited to the linear-response regime, and we present the first results for nonlinear magnetic excitations from first principles in iron.},

 abstract = {Adiabatic nuclear potential energy surfaces (PESs) defined via the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation are a fundamental concept underlying chemical reactivity theory. For a wide range of excited-state phenomena such as radiationless decay, energy and charge transfer, and photochemical reactions, the BO approximation breaks down due to strong couplings between two or more BO PESs. Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) is the method of choice to model these processes. We review new developments in quantum–classical dynamics, analytical derivative methods, and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) which have lead to a dramatic expansion of the scope of ab initio NAMD simulations for molecular systems in recent years. We focus on atom-centered Gaussian basis sets allowing highly efficient simulations for molecules and clusters, especially in conjunction with hybrid density functionals. Using analytical derivative techniques, forces and derivative couplings can be obtained with machine precision in a given basis set, which is crucial for accurate and stable dynamics. We illustrate the performance of surface-hopping TDDFT for photochemical reactions of the lowest singlet excited states of cyclohexadiene, several vitamin D derivatives, and a bicyclic cyclobutene. With few exceptions, the calculated quantum yields and excited state lifetimes agree qualitatively with experiment. For systems with ∼50 atoms, the present TURBOMOLE implementation allows NAMD simulations with 0.2–0.4 ns total simulation time using hybrid density functionals and polarized double zeta valence basis sets on medium-size compute clusters. We close by discussing open problems and future directions.},

A DC field of the order of the gap induces a metallic state characterized by polaronic features in the gap region and a partially inverted population. In this quasi-steady state, the field-induced doublon-hole production is balanced by a phonon-enhanced doublon-hole recombination. The photo-excitation of carriers by a pulsed field leads to similar modifications of the electronic structure in the gap region, and an associated reduction of the doublon life-time. We demonstrate that the field-induced localization of electrons effectively enhances the phonon coupling, an effect which should be measureable with time-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy.}

This book describes spin-orbit coupling effects in quasi-two-dimensional electron and hole systems. The first part provides a general introduction to the electronic structure of quasi-two-dimensional systems with a particular focus on group-theoretical methods. The main part of the monograph is devoted to spin-orbit coupling phenomena at zero and nonzero magnetic fields. Throughout the book, the main focus is on a thorough discussion of the physical ideas and a detailed interpretation of the results. Accurate numerical calculations are complemented by simple and transparent analytical models that capture the important physics.},

abstract = {Real-time, time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) has gained popularity as a first-principles approach to study a variety of excited-state phenomena such as optical excitations and electronic stopping. Within RT-TDDFT simulations, the gauge freedom of the time-dependent electronic orbitals can be exploited for numerical and scientific convenience while the unitary transformation does not alter physical properties calculated from the quantum dynamics of electrons. Exploiting this gauge freedom, we demonstrate the propagation of maximally localized Wannier functions within RT-TDDFT. We illustrate its great utility through a number of examples including its application to optical excitation in extended systems using the so-called length gauge, interpreting electronic stopping excitation, and simulating electric field-driven quantized charge transport. We implemented the approach within our plane-wave pseudopotential RT-TDDFT module of the QB@LL code, and the performance of the implementation is also discussed.},
