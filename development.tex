QMCPACK library

As requested by the program, one of the central objectives of the first half of the NPNEQ center was the delivery of a performant GPU DFT code to tackle non-perturbative and non-equilibrium phenomena studied by the center.
INQ is a new implementation of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) written from scratch to work on graphical processing units (GPUs).  
Besides GPU support,INQ makes use of modern code design features and takes advantage of newly available hardware.
By designing the code around algorithms, rather than against specific implementations and numerical  libraries, we aim to provide a concise and modular code.
The result is a fairly complete DFT/TDDFT implementation in roughly 12,000 lines of open-source C++code representing a modular platform for community-driven application development on emerging high-performance computing architectures.

Talk about libraries used by QMCPACK also.


Outreach activities include the organization of a symposium at the 2021 Molecular Foundry Annual User meeting (August 19-20, 2021). The symposium, entitled “Non-Equilibrium and Non-Perturbative Experimental and Theoretical Methods for Dynamical Science”, aims to survey recent progress in manipulation, measurement, and simulation of non-equilibrium dynamics. Alongside the symposium organization, the INQ team will also be presenting a tutorial-style introduction to the INQ code during the Molecular Foundry User Meeting, as a way to introduce the code to the electronic structure community.
