	abstract = {Optically induced phase transitions of the manganite Pr1/3Ca2/3MnO3 have been simulated by using a model Hamiltonian that captures the dynamics of strongly correlated charge, orbital, lattice, and spin degrees of freedom. Its parameters have been extracted from first-principles calculations. Beyond a critical intensity of a femtosecond light pulse, the material undergoes an ultrafast and nonthermal magnetic phase transition from a noncollinear to collinear antiferromagnetic phase. The light-pulse excites selectively either a spin-nematic or a ferroelectric phase, depending on the light polarization. The behavior can be traced to an optically induced ferromagnetic coupling between Mn trimers, i.e., polarons which are delocalized over three Mn sites. The polarization guides the polymerization of the polaronic crystal into distinct patterns of ferromagnetic chains determining the target phase.},

	abstract = {Solid systems with strong correlations and interactions under light illumination have the potential for exhibiting interesting bulk photovoltaic behavior in the non-perturbative regime, which has remained largely unexplored in the past theoretical studies. We investigate the bulk photovoltaic response of a perovskite manganite with strongly coupled electron-spin-lattice dynamics, using real-time simulations performed with a tight-binding model. The transient changes in the band structure and the photoinduced phase transitions, emerging from spin and phonon dynamics, result in a nonlinear current versus intensity behavior beyond the perturbative limit. The current rises sharply across a photoinduced magnetic phase transition, which later saturates at higher light intensities due to excited phonon and spin modes. The predicted peak photoresponsivity is orders of magnitude higher than other known ferroelectric oxides such as BiFeO\$\_3\$. We disentangle phonon-and spin-assisted components to the ballistic photocurrent, showing that they are comparable in magnitude. Our results illustrate a promising alternative way for controlling and optimizing the bulk photovoltaic response through the photoinduced phase transitions in strongly-correlated systems.},

Besides GPU support, INQ makes use of modern code design features and takes advantage of newly available hardware. By designing the code around algorithms, rather than against specific implementations and numerical libraries, we aim to provide a concise and modular code. The result is a fairly complete DFT/TDDFT implementation in roughly 12,000 lines of open-source C++ code representing a modular platform for community-driven application development on emerging high-performance computing architectures for the simulation of materials.},
