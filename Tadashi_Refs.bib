	abstract = {Optically induced phase transitions of the manganite Pr1/3Ca2/3MnO3 have been simulated by using a model Hamiltonian that captures the dynamics of strongly correlated charge, orbital, lattice, and spin degrees of freedom. Its parameters have been extracted from first-principles calculations. Beyond a critical intensity of a femtosecond light pulse, the material undergoes an ultrafast and nonthermal magnetic phase transition from a noncollinear to collinear antiferromagnetic phase. The light-pulse excites selectively either a spin-nematic or a ferroelectric phase, depending on the light polarization. The behavior can be traced to an optically induced ferromagnetic coupling between Mn trimers, i.e., polarons which are delocalized over three Mn sites. The polarization guides the polymerization of the polaronic crystal into distinct patterns of ferromagnetic chains determining the target phase.},

	abstract = {Solid systems with strong correlations and interactions under light illumination have the potential for exhibiting interesting bulk photovoltaic behavior in the non-perturbative regime, which has remained largely unexplored in the past theoretical studies. We investigate the bulk photovoltaic response of a perovskite manganite with strongly coupled electron-spin-lattice dynamics, using real-time simulations performed with a tight-binding model. The transient changes in the band structure and the photoinduced phase transitions, emerging from spin and phonon dynamics, result in a nonlinear current versus intensity behavior beyond the perturbative limit. The current rises sharply across a photoinduced magnetic phase transition, which later saturates at higher light intensities due to excited phonon and spin modes. The predicted peak photoresponsivity is orders of magnitude higher than other known ferroelectric oxides such as BiFeO\$\_3\$. We disentangle phonon-and spin-assisted components to the ballistic photocurrent, showing that they are comparable in magnitude. Our results illustrate a promising alternative way for controlling and optimizing the bulk photovoltaic response through the photoinduced phase transitions in strongly-correlated systems.},

By designing the code around algorithms, rather than against specific implementations and numerical libraries, we aim to provide a concise and modular code. The result is a fairly complete DFT/TDDFT implementation in roughly 12,000 lines of open-source C++ code representing a modular platform for community-driven application development on emerging high-performance computing architectures for the simulation of materials.},

We present a highly optimized multiple graphics processing unit implementation of the exact exchange operator which allows one to perform fast hybrid functional density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with systematic basis sets without additional approximations for up to a thousand atoms. With this method hybrid DFT calculations of high quality become accessible on state-of-the-art supercomputers within a time-to-solution that is of the same order of magnitude as traditional semilocal-GGA functionals. The method is implemented in a portable open-source library.}

abstract = {We present SPARC: Simulation Package for Ab-initio Real-space Calculations. SPARC can perform Kohn–Sham density functional theory calculations for isolated systems such as molecules as well as extended systems such as crystals and surfaces, in both static and dynamic settings. It is straightforward to install/use and highly competitive with state-of-the-art planewave codes, demonstrating comparable performance on a small number of processors and increasing advantages as the number of processors grows. Notably, SPARC brings solution times down to a few seconds for systems with O(100–500) atoms on large-scale parallel computers, outperforming planewave counterparts by an order of magnitude and more.}

abstract="Exascale computing aspires to meet the increasing demands from large scientific applications. Software targeting exascale is typically designed for heterogeneous architectures; henceforth, it is not only important to develop well-designed software, but also make it aware of the hardware architecture and efficiently exploit its power. Currently, several and diverse applications, such as those part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) in the United States, rely on efficient computation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In this context, we present the design and implementation of heFFTe (Highly Efficient FFT for Exascale) library, which targets the upcoming exascale supercomputers. We provide highly (linearly) scalable GPU kernels that achieve more than {\$}{\$}40{\{}{\backslash}times {\}}{\$}{\$}speedup with respect to local kernels from CPU state-of-the-art libraries, and over {\$}{\$}2{\{}{\backslash}times {\}}{\$}{\$}speedup for the whole FFT computation. A communication model for parallel FFTs is also provided to analyze the bottleneck for large-scale problems. We show experiments obtained on Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, using up to 24,576 IBM Power9 cores and 6,144 NVIDIA V-100 GPUs.",

	abstract = {Halide perovskites are strongly influenced by large amplitude anharmonic lattice fluctuations at room temperature. We develop a tight binding model for dynamically disordered MAPbI\$\_3\$ based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations to calculate electronic structure for finite temperature crystal structures at the length scale of thermal disorder and carrier localization. The model predicts individual Hamiltonian matrix elements and band structures with high accuracy, owing to the inclusion of additional matrix elements and descriptors for non-Coulombic interactions. We apply the model to electronic structure calculations in supercells up to 16 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 16 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 16, observing the onset of carrier localization induced by thermal disorder at 300 K, associated with decreasing band edge fluctuations, increasing carrier mass, and Rashba splitting approaching zero. We identify the length scale \$L{\textasciicircum}*= 5\$ nm at which local electronic structure is affected by dynamic disorder.},
